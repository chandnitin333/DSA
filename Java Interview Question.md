Here are Java interview questions with answers for a 6-7 years experienced developer, covering Core Java, Multithreading, Collections, Java 8, Spring, Hibernate, and Microservices.

1. Core Java
Q1: What is the difference between an Abstract Class and an Interface?
Answer:
Feature	Abstract Class	Interface
Methods	Can have abstract and concrete methods	Only abstract methods (Java 7), default/static methods (Java 8)
Fields	Can have instance variables	Only constants (public static final)
Constructor	Can have a constructor	Cannot have a constructor
Multiple Inheritance	Cannot be extended by multiple classes	Can be implemented by multiple classes
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();
}

interface Movable {
    void move();
}

class Dog extends Animal implements Movable {
    void makeSound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
    public void move() { System.out.println("Running"); }
}
Q2: What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?
Answer:
Keyword	Usage
final	Used with variables (constant), methods (cannot override), and classes (cannot inherit)
finally	Block that executes after try-catch, used for cleanup
finalize()	Method called by Garbage Collector before object destruction
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
final class Test {}

// finally block usage
try {
    int x = 5 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Exception caught");
} finally {
    System.out.println("Finally block executed");
}

// finalize method
protected void finalize() {
    System.out.println("Object is garbage collected");
}
2. Collections Framework
Q3: How does HashMap work internally?
Answer:
HashMap stores key-value pairs using an array of Node<K, V>.
It uses hashCode() and equals() to store and retrieve elements.
If hash collisions occur, it uses a Linked List (before Java 8) or Balanced Tree (Java 8+).
Default capacity = 16, Load Factor = 0.75 (resizing happens when 75% full).
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("Alice", 25);
map.put("Bob", 30);
System.out.println(map.get("Alice"));
Q4: Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
Answer:
Feature	ArrayList	LinkedList
Data Structure	Dynamic array	Doubly Linked List
Access	Fast (O(1), index-based)	Slow (O(n), needs traversal)
Insertion/Deletion	Slow (O(n), shifting required)	Fast (O(1), just update pointers)
Memory Usage	Less (stores only values)	More (stores values + pointers)
3. Multithreading and Concurrency
Q5: What is the difference between synchronized and ReentrantLock?
Answer:
Feature	synchronized	ReentrantLock
Locking	Implicit	Explicit (lock() and unlock())
Flexibility	No timeout	Supports timeout
Fairness	No fairness	Can be fair (new ReentrantLock(true))
Interruptible Locking	No	Yes (lockInterruptibly())
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
lock.lock();
try {
    System.out.println("Critical Section");
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
Q6: What is volatile in Java?
Answer:
Ensures visibility of changes to a variable across threads.
Prevents caching or reordering of variable reads/writes.
Does not provide atomicity (use synchronized for that).
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
class SharedData {
    volatile int count = 0;
}
4. Java 8 Features
Q7: Difference between map() and flatMap()?
Answer:
map() transforms each element into one new element.
flatMap() transforms each element into multiple elements and flattens.
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("Hello", "World");
List<String> chars = words.stream().flatMap(str -> Arrays.stream(str.split(""))).collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(chars); // [H, e, l, l, o, W, o, r, l, d]
Q8: How does Optional prevent NullPointerException?
Answer:
Wraps values to avoid null checks.
Use orElse(), orElseGet(), orElseThrow().
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable(null);
System.out.println(name.orElse("Default"));
5. Spring Framework
Q9: Difference between @Controller and @RestController?
Answer:
Annotation	Purpose
@Controller	Returns View (JSP/Thymeleaf)
@RestController	Returns JSON (REST API)
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@RestController
public class MyController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
Q10: What is @Transactional in Spring?
Answer:
Ensures all DB operations inside a method are either fully committed or rolled back.
Works with Spring ORM (Hibernate, JPA).
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Transactional
public void transferMoney() {
    accountDao.debit(100);
    accountDao.credit(100);
}
6. Hibernate & JPA
Q11: What is Lazy vs Eager fetching?
Answer:
Fetch Type	Description
LAZY	Loads data only when needed (recommended)
EAGER	Loads related entities immediately (may cause performance issues)
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Entity
class Employee {
    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private List<Address> addresses;
}
7. Microservices & Cloud
Q12: What is Circuit Breaker pattern?
Answer:
Prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to a failing service.
Implemented using Resilience4j or Hystrix.
Example using Resilience4j:

java
Copy
Edit
@CircuitBreaker(name = "myService", fallbackMethod = "fallback")
public String callExternalService() {
    return restTemplate.getForObject("http://external-service", String.class);
}

public String fallback(Exception e) {
    return "Fallback response";
}
8. System Design & Best Practices
Q13: How to design a URL Shortener like Bit.ly?
Answer:
Components:
Database: MySQL/NoSQL (Redis)
Hashing: Base62 Encoding
Load Balancing: Nginx
Caching: Redis
Scaling: Microservices
